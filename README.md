# Fritz!Box transfer speed monitor

Show what the current bandwidth usage is on a Fritz!Box in your network.

*I don't have a Fritz!Box anymore, so there likely will be no further development. Feel free to take over the project, just let me know, so I can link to you.*

## Setup
 
You need python 2.7, [docopt](http://docopt.org/) and [SOAPpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SOAPpy) installed. The last two can be installed as follows:

```
pip install docopt SOAPpy
```

## Usage

Run `python fb_transfer.py --help` for usage instructions.
