# Fritz!Box transfer speed monitor

Show what the current bandwidth usage is on a Fritz!Box in your network.

You need Python 2 and [SOAPpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SOAPpy) installed. Run `python fb_transfer.py --help` for usage instructions.

*I don't have a Fritz!Box anymore, so there likely will be no further development. Feel free to take over the project, just let me know, so I can link to you.*
